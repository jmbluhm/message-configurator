1,AI Agent,Hello! I can help you launch your first involuntary churn remediation campaign using Recurly Engage. This will help you recover subscribers who experience failed payments by showing them in-app prompts to update their payment information. Ready to get started?\n,,true
2,Merchant,Yes! We're losing a lot of subscribers to expired cards. What do we need to do?,,true
3,AI Agent,"Perfect use case. Let me check your current Recurly setup first...\n\nGreat news—I can see Recurly Engage is already integrated with your account. I've found a pre-built ""Failed Payment"" guide that we can customize for your needs.\nBefore we dive in, quick question: Do you want this campaign to target all subscribers with failed payments, or would you like to start with a specific subscription plan?",[RA check engage api to see if site_id exists in external_tenant_id tenants API and sends metadata to ADK. Someday: Engage subagent in ADK can check by site_id if the site has engage enabled. Note: This all may break in q1. Spike + Alex Smith to convene (olivia will help)],true
4,Merchant,Let's start with all failed payments to maximize recovery.,,false
5,AI Agent,Smart approach. Here's what we're going to publish:\n\nCampaign Overview:\nName: Failed Payment Recovery Campaign\nTarget: All active subscribers with failed payment attempts\nTrigger: Appears when subscriber logs in after a payment failure\nFlow: Single-prompt overlay asking them to update their payment method with a 1-click fix\nExpected Impact: Industry average shows 15-25% recovery rate for failed payments with in-app prompts\n\nDoes this sound right for your first campaign?,,true
6,Merchant,"Yes, that works. What about the messaging? Can I customize what they see?",,false
7,AI Agent,"Absolutely! Let me pull up the current default message...\n\nHere's what subscribers will see right now:\n\nCurrent Prompt Message:\nHeadline: ""Payment Update Needed""\nBody: ""We had trouble processing your payment. Please update your payment method to continue enjoying uninterrupted service.""\nPrimary Button: ""Update Payment Method"" Secondary Button: ""Remind Me Later""\n\nWould you like to edit this message to match your brand voice better? I can help you revise the copy.",[Agent fetches current prompt configuration],true
8,Merchant,"Yeah, that feels a bit formal for our brand. Can we make it friendlier?",,false
9,AI Agent,"Definitely. What if we tried something like this:\n\nRevised Prompt:\nHeadline: ""Uh oh! Your payment didn't go through""\nBody: ""No worries—it happens! Your card may have expired or there might be a temporary issue. Update your payment info in just one click and you're all set.""\nPrimary Button: ""Fix It Now"" Secondary Button: ""Remind Me Later""\n\nHow does that feel?",,true
10,Merchant,"Much better! I like ""Fix It Now."" Can we use that?",,false
11,AI Agent,"Perfect! Let me update that...\n✓ Prompt message updated successfully.\n\nNow, let's configure the behavior when subscribers click ""Fix It Now."" Currently it's set to open a new tab to your account management page. Since you have Recurly's Hosted Account Management, we can make this even smoother—they'll go directly to the payment update section. Should we keep it that way or would you prefer a different behavior?",[Agent updates prompt configuration via Engage API],true
12,Merchant,"Direct to payment update sounds perfect. What happens if they click ""Remind Me Later""?",,false
13,AI Agent,"Good question. Right now, ""Remind Me Later"" will dismiss the prompt, and it won't show again for 24 hours. We can adjust this window—anywhere from 4 hours to 7 days. What makes sense for your business?",,true
14,Merchant,24 hours is fine. We don't want to annoy them but we also need them to fix it quickly.,,false
15,AI Agent,"That's a good balance.
